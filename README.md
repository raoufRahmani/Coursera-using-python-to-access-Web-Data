# Using Python to Access Web Data – Course Projects

This repository has exercises and small projects I did for the **"Using Python to Access Web Data"** course by the University of Michigan on Coursera, taught by Dr. Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck).
At the start of each module, I wrote what we will learn to make it easier to understand.

## Course Overview

This course teaches how to get and work with data from the web using Python, including:

* Regular expressions (`re`)
* Using `urllib` to read web pages
* Parsing HTML with `BeautifulSoup`
* Reading and parsing XML and JSON data
* Working with APIs like the Google Maps API

## Contents

The repo has all 6 modules from the course. For each, I added the assignments and explanations for the harder parts:

* Module 1: Simple setup to prepare the Python environment
* Module 2: Regular expressions – how to find things like emails in text
* Module 3: Networks and sockets – how the internet works and how Python gets data from websites and APIs
* Module 4: Programs that surf the Web – learn to find and extract (scrape) data from real websites using requests and BeautifulSoup
* Module 5: Web services and XML – use Python to get XML data from the web, find numbers inside tags, and add them using `urllib` and `ElementTree`
* Module 6: Work with APIs / Web Services using JSON data format

## Libraries

* `urllib`, `re`, `json`, `xml`, `ssl`
* `BeautifulSoup`
